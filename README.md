## About

I have spent time creating user-friendly web and mobile solutions for more than three years, and my specialty expertise is using JavaScript frameworks like React, Node.js, and React Native. Motivated by a growth mindset, I have a strong desire to turn difficult issues into approachable, user-focused solutions that have a significant influence.
